# AI Lunar Landing using Deep Q Learning

Implement Deep Q Learning for training agent to do save landing to the moon (using Lunar Landing Atari environment).
After done about 726-ish training session Agent can do Landing safely in the environment and we finally got trained Agent.


## Training Process
In total it take 3 hours 10 minutes and 9 seconds for AI agent to learn landing safely. here is the preview (I only show first 30 minutes learning process)

## Train Result
After the Agent got trained finally we got our Agent do this.
